#### Error-Free Transformations

These are information presevering operations that restructure aritmetic interactions of numerical quantities.
Simultaneously noiseless and clarifying, they are easy to apply and resiliant in use (see /src/arith/op/).

*This package is __error-free transformation__ reliant.*
